This is a list of over 100,000 English words transcribed
orthographically. I obtained it from The Interociter bulletin
board in Dallas (214/258-1832). The original read.me file said
that the list came from Public Brand Software.

The original list contained 146,440 words, but I discovered that
there were thousands of duplicate words. I resorted the list and
removed the duplicates using the Unix utility uniq. The total
number of words is now 109,582. I have repackaged the list into
four files (the original was five):

A higher order function is simply a function that either accepts functions as arguments or returns a function. For example, in mathematics, the derivative is a higher order function. Three higher order functions appear in virtually every functional programming language and can be considered a de facto canon. These are map, fold (or reduce), and filter. These functions abstract iteration over lists, which is ubiquitous in a vectorized language like R. A map echoes the mathematical sense of the word, as a procedure that transforms every element of a set by the same function. The output of map is typically one-to-one with the input. Fold, on the other hand, is a mechanism to aggregate a set of data into a single value. The summation and product operators are good examples of this, where a vector is collapsed into a single value. The final function returns a subset of a list, based on some predicate. Some set operations (e.g. set difference) are examples of a filter operation.

This word list includes inflected forms, such as plural nouns and
the -s, -ed and -ing forms of verbs. Thus the number of lexical stems
represented in the list is considerably smaller than the total
number of words.
